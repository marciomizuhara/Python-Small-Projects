ABOUT ME

Data  scientist  and  Data  analyst  with  experience  in  modeling  and 
maintenance  of  terminology  databases.    As  a  translator,    I  had  the 
opportunity to work with datawarehouses and terminology databases. 
I am looking for a new opportunity in the Data Science industry so as to 
offer my skills and expertise in deep analysis, storytelling and attention 
to details. I have solid knowledge in the ETL process, SQL, Python and 
in  the  libraries  Pandas,  Numpy,  Matplotlib  and  Seaborn,  as  well  as  in 
the  development  of  Python  web  applications  with  Flask  and  Django.
