# Alphabetical Folder Organizer

A script that organizes a given folder into subfolders alphabetically. For example, if there is a file named *"program.exe"*, a folder named *"p"* will be created and said file will be moved there.

### How to use:
* Run the **main.py** file;
* The terminal will prompt you to enter the full path of the directory you want to organize;
* All the files will be moved to the specified folder.
