# Renaming Bulk Files

A script that renames, incrementally, all the files of a given folder.

### How to use:
* Run the **main.py** file;
* The terminal will prompt you to enter the full path of the directory you want to rename files from;
* Then you'll be prompted to enter the extension (without the dot) of the files you want to rename. Example: jpg, mp4, txt and so on;
* Finally, you'll be asked to enter the new filename prefix to be set for the files;
* All the files with the specified extension will be renamed to the chosen new filename.
